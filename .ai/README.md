# .ai/ - AI Integration & Automation for Airnub Prefect Starter

This directory is reserved for resources, blueprints, and prompts related to leveraging AI coding assistants and automation tools with the **Airnub Prefect Starter** template.

## Vision: AI-Augmented Pipeline Development

The goal of this template is to be highly structured and convention-driven, which makes it an ideal candidate for significant AI-assisted development. We envision a future where AI agents can dramatically accelerate the creation, modification, testing, and maintenance of data pipelines built using this starter.

This `README.md` outlines some potential future uses and goals for AI integration. Users and contributors are encouraged to explore these possibilities and potentially contribute more specific blueprints or prompt libraries to this directory as best practices emerge.

## Potential Future Implementations & Goals

### 1. `AI_BLUEPRINT.md` (Conceptual)
* A future, detailed, machine-readable (and human-readable) specification of the entire template.
* **Could enable an AI to:**
    * Deeply understand the template's architecture, conventions, data models, flow structures, generator script logic, and component interactions.
    * Generate new departments, categories, tasks, or even full flows based on high-level requirements.
    * Assist in refactoring data science prototype code (from `airnub_prefect_starter/data_science/`) into operational Prefect workflows using `airnub_prefect_starter/core/` logic.
    * Help maintain consistency as a project built from this template scales.
    * Draft updates to documentation based on code changes.

### 2. `PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` (Conceptual)
* A future, curated collection of effective prompts for use with AI coding assistants (e.g., OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot Chat, Gemini Code Assist) tailored to this template's conventions.
* **Example prompt categories could include:**
    * Scaffolding new components (e.g., "AI, using the Airnub Prefect Starter conventions, add a new category 'X' to department 'Y', stage 'Z'").
    * Implementing core logic functions in `airnub_prefect_starter/core/`.
    * Generating unit tests for core logic.
    * Explaining specific conventions of this template.

### 3. AI Server Integration (e.g., Google Vertex AI Agents, LangChain Agents - Conceptual)
* **Vision:** Explore the possibility of integrating an AI agent server that could interact with the Prefect API and project files based on natural language commands from users.
* **Potential Capabilities:**
    * "AI, set up a new Prefect flow to ingest data from this API endpoint [URL] daily, parse the key 'total_sales', and store it as a local JSON manifest. Use Project Alpha's public_api_data category as a template."
    * "AI, what Prefect flows are currently scheduled to run for dept_project_alpha?"
    * "AI, a new data file has arrived for 'scheduled_file_downloads' in Project Alpha; trigger the ingestion flow for it."
    * "AI, show me the configuration for the 'parse_api_response' task in Project Alpha's public_api_data category."
* **Considerations:** This would involve developing a dedicated AI agent with tools to interact with the Prefect client/API, understand the project's file structure (potentially guided by `AI_BLUEPRINT.md`), and execute scripts or CLI commands in a controlled environment. Technologies like Google's Agent Builder with Vertex AI, LangChain agents, or similar frameworks could be relevant here.

## Current Status & How You Can Use This Directory

* **This `.ai/` directory and its `README.md` currently serve as a placeholder to signify these future intentions and to encourage community exploration.**
* Users are encouraged to:
    * Experiment with current AI coding assistants for common development tasks within this template (e.g., implementing `TODOs`, writing core logic, generating tests, drafting documentation).
    * Develop and share effective prompts or small "blueprint" snippets within this directory if they find them useful.
* As AI tooling for code generation and project interaction matures, this directory can become a central hub for AI-specific resources for the Airnub Prefect Starter.

We believe that by fostering a well-structured template, the path to effective AI-augmented and eventually AI-automated data pipeline development becomes much clearer.
